## Data Structure Descriptors (DSDs) In Depth

Data Structure Descriptors (DSDs) are a compact representation of a (possibly non-contiguous) chunk of memory or a sequence of incoming or outgoing wavelets. Combined with DSD operations, DSDs enable various repeated operations to be expressed using just one hardware instruction.

Here are the relevant links to the SDK documentation that explain DSDs and DSD operations in depth:
- [Basic Syntax](https://sdk.cerebras.net/csl/language/dsds?highlight=input%20queue#basic-syntax)
- [One Dimensional Memory Vectors](https://sdk.cerebras.net/csl/language/dsds?highlight=input%20queue#one-dimensional-memory-vectors) - Can skip 2D, 3D and 4D sections for now, as they are not used in this tutorial, but useful to know about for future reference.
- [Fabric Input Vectors](https://sdk.cerebras.net/csl/language/dsds?highlight=input%20queue#fabric-input-vectors)
- [Fabric Output Vectors](https://sdk.cerebras.net/csl/language/dsds?highlight=input%20queue#fabric-output-vectors)
- [Asynchronous DSD Operations](https://sdk.cerebras.net/csl/language/dsds?highlight=input%20queue#asynchronous-dsd-operations)
