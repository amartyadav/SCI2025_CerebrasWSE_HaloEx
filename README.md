This repository contains everything related to this tutorial for the attendees to use during and after the tutorial. 
In particular, you will find the
 - tutorial presentation slides,
 - the completed reference code,
 - the incomplete code which will be used for teaching at the tutorial,
 - links to important pages (documentation, user sdk user forum etc),
 - (anything else that is found to be important)


The work (especially the code and the research with it) being presented in this tutorial and the repository was developed by <a href="https://amartyadav.com" target="_blank">Amartya Yadav</a> 
at EPCC, University of Edinburgh
as part of the MSc dissertation. 

The MSc dissertation was - _**"Implementing Lattice-Boltzmann method solver for Computational Fluid Dynamics on the Cerebras WSE-3".**_
